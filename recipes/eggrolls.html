        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large skillet or wok set over medium heat, add the ground chicken, garlic, and ginger.
                Season with salt, pepper, and Chinese five spice powder. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked
                through, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Add in the shredded coleslaw, carrots, green onions, and sesame oil. Stir
                to combine and cook for 4-5 minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon of water.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Lay an egg roll wrapper on a clean surface with one corner pointing towards you
                Spoon 2 table spoons of the chicken mixture onto the center of the wrapper.
                Fold the bottom corner up over the filling, then fold the sides in towards the center.
                Brush the top corner with the egg wash and roll the wrapper tightly to seal.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Repeat with the remaining egg roll wrappers and filling.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Heat 2 inches of oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until
                it reaches 350 degrees fahrenheit. Fry the egg rolls in batches until they
                are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Drain the egg rolls on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.
            </li>
